abstract = {The design of video games has been driven primarily by innovations in graphics technology and our ability to model physical spaces. However, the exploration of other areas of game design, such as interactive and social storyworlds, has been relatively slow. Games featuring complex story-driven gameplay are rare because we lack playable models of these design areas. Unlike graphics and physics simulations with their common language of mathematics, models of social interaction and storytelling have no such representation to serve as a basis for creating playable models of their domains. Additionally, we have little knowledge of how to present these types of gameplay to players as examples from which insight can be drawn are rare. Current games that contain playable social interactions or storyworlds either have limited content caused by the large growth of story spaces to be authored, such as computer role playing games that use dialogue trees, or have abstract interactions that tell no concrete story, such as many social life simulation games. These games either offer a limited complexity of choices to the player with detailed realization of character interactions in the storyworld or a significant amount of player choice complexity with abstract character interactions. This problems are addressed in this dissertation via Comme il Faut (CiF), a playable model of social interaction and authoring approach for creating social storyworlds. Through drawing inspiration from social science, particularly dramaturgical analysis, CiF provides a knowledge represent that is able to encode and reason about social interaction in a way that is amenable to authoring storyworlds. This knowledge representation enables the retargeting of performances consisting of fully-realized character dialogue to contextually appropriate social situations. This allows for the creation of storyworlds with a new level of player choice complexity with detailed realization of character interactions. Additionally, the combination of a procedural playable model with performance retargeting provides a solution to problem of authoring storyworlds with high player choice complexity. To explore the newly-opened area of design while testing and improving CiF, Prom Week, a critically acclaimed experimental game featuring social game play via CiF, was created and released to the public. Because the game features a large amount of content used to enable a large space of stories for the player to explore, this dissertation features descriptions of the design, authoring approach, and design insights learned while creating Prom Week. Additionally, this dissertation includes evaluations of Prom Week based on player traces to determine the both how Prom Week provides customized gameplay experience to players and to determine if players are exhibiting strategic play. This is followed by a comparison of authoring and complexity of story space of Prom Week with the best of the story-driven computer role playing games. To compliment CiF's turn-based interactions, this dissertation features a description of the Holodeck system, a test bed for socially aware AI avatars taking the roles of supporting characters, and an evaluation explore the complications that arise when using social artificial intelligence systems in real-time environments.},

We hypothesize that social behavior can be decomposed into social games, which are collections of affordances surrounding social state, and claim that non-scripted player interactions can be generated by the execution of social games in various combinations. We describe three social games (for alliance, authority, and threat management), the implementation architecture that executes these games, and the resulting behavior, which is set in a military house-search scenario. The architecture consists of a decision process that selects motivations appropriate to the games, selects social moves appropriate to the motivations, and finally performs behaviors that implement social moves, all in a situation-responsive, dynamic fashion. We show that social games form a loosely coupled system that generates a space of possible interactions.}

Are some more accurate than others for a particular game, or in general? If so, why? Is the appropriate metric for a given game determined by certain characteristics of the game’s design? This work provides an experimental methodology for validating play trace dissimilarity metrics for conformance to game designers’ perception of play trace difference. We apply this method to a game-independent metric called Gamalyzer and compare it against three baselines which are representative of commonly used techniques in game analytics. We find that Gamalyzer—with an appropriate input encoding—is more accurate than the baseline metrics for the specific game under consideration, but simpler metrics based on event counting perform nearly as well for this game.}

CiF models characters with a complex set of traits, feelings, and relationships, who can form intents, take actions, relate to a shared cultural space, and remember and refer to past events. A set of authored rules encoding appropriate behavior within a specific story world allow these characters to select actions to take (and respond to actions by others) in a manner consistent with their own personal and social concerns as well as a shifting interpersonal context. Through the development and release of Prom Week, a complete game using CiF as its narrative engine, we show how the system successfully creates complex narratives that are unique for each player and directed by those players’ attempts to make progress towards story goals. We also show how CiF continues to be used in several in-progress interactive experiences (Mismanor and IMMERSE), speaking to the utility and flexibility of its design.}

abstract = {New player experiences require new game designs – and some designs only become possible with new technology. Emergent narratives are part of existing story games but the game systems are not capable of understanding the stories their players create. If we could capture the enjoyable aspects of player-driven narratives while still keeping the complex dynamism of sandbox games, we could enable a new type of game experience. Creating this experience would require fundamental technical research to
enable new kinds of authorial affordances.
This paper presents the lessons learned while designing the game Prom Week and AI system Comme il Faut together to produce such an experience — a two and a half year process of research-driven game design. Prom Week tightly combines player experiences of choice and consequence (as found, for example, in simulation games and combat systems) with experiences of specific characters, histories, language, and narrative conclusions (as found in the non-interactive, or minimally-interactive, fictions of many games). This combination was accomplished by creating novel technology informed by the design problem, experimenting with gameplay approaches appropriate to the technology, iterating on both using player feedback, and finally executing a unique design providing satisfying stories that reflect the player's choices in a wide possibility space.}

We describe the playable experience produced by the system, the implementation architecture (based on the behavior specification technology used in Façade, the social model employed in Prom Week, and gesture recognition technology), and illustrate the key behaviors and programming idioms that enable character performance. These idioms include orthogonal coding of attitudes and activities, use of relational rules to nominate social behavior, use of volition rules to rank options, and priority based interleaving of character animations. }

Using the abstraction of the social game, Comme il Faut creates experiences where specific dramatic interactions between characters arise from play. This paper describes the process of authoring for Comme il Faut. Specifically, we will describe the authoring and design considerations for Comme il Faut's inaugural game, The Prom. We discuss how we extracted and encoded an exaggerated social logic from pre-existing media experiences to create its intended story space, developed an idiosyncratic local culture for its story world, defined a set of character histories and personalities to be revealed through play, and authored the specific lines of dialogue and motivating social situations that give the audience experience of The Prom its particular character. Together, these produce an experience with much greater fictional specificity than in open-ended simulation games and many more options for what happens (and how things happen) than in traditional game stories.},

abstract = {Modern video games have highly developed computational models of physical space, which allow sophisticated play in the physical realm. However, computational models of social interaction are rare, offer limited social play, and require a large amount of authoring to create. We believe that a computational model of social interaction inspired by appropriate humanities and social science concepts could help alleviate these problems and open up new areas of social play. In this paper, we describe a playable model called Comme il Faut that uses a social artificial intelligence system particularly inspired by Goffman's dramaturgical analysis and Berne's psychological games, constructed for authoring power rather than fidelity with the everyday world. Our theoretical basis, the system's relation to other digital media and games, and its implementation are presented to explain Comme il Faut and our approach to enabling social play.},

The generation of this face data can be approached in ways varying from pure computation to pure data acquisition. Computational models are flexible but can lack realism and intuitive or simple controls, while data-driven models produce realistic faces, but necessitate the often slow and cumbersome capture of new scan data for every desired set of face attributes. Our method is a hybrid approach, which combines a relatively small set of real world facial data with a computational algorithm that learns the underlying variations in this geometric information automatically. Given a sparse data set that spans variation in viseme, face type, and expression, we are able to generate new faces that exhibit combinations of these attributes, and were never part of the original data set. We rely on user-assisted categorization of our sparse data set to associate each piece of face data with a small set of attribute contributions, and then use this categorization data as a guide for binding abstract variation to concrete parameters. This process takes the complex, subtle, and often subjective qualities associated with visemes, expressions, and face types, and correlates them to known geometric features, in order to facilitate the creation of entirely new face poses.}

Next, we propose several metrics for evaluating agents attempting to achieve this level of realism and test our proposed metrics in a social interaction experiment set in a virtual bar amidst a variety of human and computer controlled patrons. Finally, we employ these metrics to measure the SCR performance of traditional scripted bots and prototype AI-driven agents. Our results show that SCR is not only a distinguishable and measurable metric of agent realism, but also a technically achievable goal within the reach of modern AI techniques.}

We argue that the development of innovative artificial intelligence (AI) systems plays a crucial role in the exploration of currently unreachable spaces. To aid in exploration, we suggest a practice called AI-based game design, an iterative design process that deeply integrates the affordances of an AI system within the context of game design. We have applied this process in our own projects, and in this paper we present how it has pushed the boundaries of current game genres and experiences, as well as discuss the future AI-based game design.}

abstract = {Technologies are described herein for providing dynamic natural language interactions between a user and a computing device. In one aspect, a computing device managing a conversation with a user is enhanced with the identification and management of one or more topics. Using techniques described herein, the computing device can focus on one or more topics, shift between topics and/or introduce new topics. Techniques disclosed herein may also manage and process interruptions that may be introduced during a conversation. Dynamic access of contextual information may assist in the generation of contextually-relevant statements, and the contextual information may be used to balance priorities between various topics. Each topic may also have an associated decay rate so that the lifespan of individual topics may track realistic scenarios. In addition, the priorities of individual topics may be dynamically adjusted so topics may track events created by a user and a computing device.}

abstract = {Convincing and compelling virtual environments that are populated with rich characters demand consistent, nuanced, and realistic behavior that is integrated in the surrounding environment. Inadequate and unscalable traditional Artificial Intelligence based approaches have made it impractical to apply this level of character depth and detail to large environments. We introduce the concept of Supporting Character Realism (SCR) for virtual avatars by identifying the capabilities of agents which have the ability to work in tandem with traditional “main character realism” approaches by demonstrating consistent and nuanced behaviors that blend into the surrounding background environment. Next, we propose several metrics for evaluating agents attempting to achieve this level of realism and test our proposed metrics in a rich social interaction experiment placed in a virtual bar amidst a variety of human and computer controlled patrons. Finally, we gauge the performance of a set of both traditional scripted bots and prototype AI-driven agents designed to target our concept of SCR. Our results show that SCR is not only a distinguishable and measurable metric of agent realism, but also a technically achievable goal within the reach of modern AI techniques.},
